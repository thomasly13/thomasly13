<h2 align="center"> Hi there! I'm Thomas!ðŸ‘‹ </h2>

<p align="center">Whether it's tutoring students at my local high school, to volunteering at my local police department, I have always had a passion to help anyone I see and strive to develop software that can do the same. I love not only learning about the problems people face, but researching new technologies and creating innovative solutions to these problems.</p>
